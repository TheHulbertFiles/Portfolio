            <p>&emsp;I am a graduate of Information Technology and Computer Science. My education
                prepared me in most areas of application and website development from scratch to
                completion. This includes back end systems, front end user interfaces, devops,
                database management, and the ability to pick up new skills with ease.</p>
            <p>&emsp;These skills have allowed me to grow in my professional career with the ability
                to think &quot;outside&ndash;the&ndash;box&quot;. While my work experience is not
                strictly technical, I was able to develop analytical skills and provide contributions
                to system and workflow development. For example, automation of redundant tasks.</p>
            <p>&emsp;As my career continues to grow, I seek new opportunities. I am at the point
                where my horizons need to expand so that I may enhance my skillsets and continue
                to grow. I now seek roles that are more technical in nature than business&ndash;centric.
                Ideally, I seek an entry&ndash;level engineer role that will allow me the ability
                to utilize my skills rather than allow them to fall to waste.</p>
